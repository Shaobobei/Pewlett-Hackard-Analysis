# Summary
Just doing some quick math from the “retiring employees per title table” above, Pewlett Hackard would need no less than 70k position filled; and that is still cutting it short, for them to not feel too much of an impact.  Looking at the “retiring _titles” table we can see that there 72,458 employees are ready to retire and based on the “mentorship_eligibilty” table only 1549 of those employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. That is a very small amount of people compared to the employees that aren’t eligible. Though I don’t think it’s impossible but clearly there are not enough mentor for the next generation of employees. One mentor would have to take on an unrealistic number of mentees. Pawlet Hackard can just hire “more experienced” people from outside the company or something a little more realistic within the company would have these mentors just mentor the employees taking over their positions and have them mentor or train the newer generation of employees. This way they are taking care and helping current employees grow and giving opportunities to new comers just staring out in their fields. Pawlet Hackard would have to start hiring as soon as possible so the new hires and newly promoted employees would have access to these mentors and when the “silver tsunami” hits they are at least little A bit more prepared
